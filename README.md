It is a mobile application code that could detect the health of a user’s heart by getting real-time data of heartbeat/pulse rate. People who had undergone bypass surgery or who is facing some problems with their heart and who can’t be monitored 24 hours by their family members, such people can install Appstroke in their mobile and wear a wrist band which is connected to the app via Bluetooth. It uses 3 sensors like pulse rate sensor to get the values of heartbeat, phone’s 3D accelerometer, and gyroscope sensors to detect the fall of user and use these values to predict and detect a heart stroke .once if the app detects the heart stroke it runs an alarm for 10 sec which in case of false positive can be dismissed by the user.if the alarm is not deactivated then the app sends automatic calls and messages to registered social contacts.
